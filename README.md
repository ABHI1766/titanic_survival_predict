# titanic_survival_predict
- cleaned the continuous and categorical feature and explored them and filled the missing value of `Age` with mean etc..
- Droped the irrelavent features in the dataset
- Plotted graph and found out some insights
- splited the cleaned data as `Train` - 60%,`Test` - 20% and `Validation` - 20%
## predicted the given data with 5 algorithms
- Logistic Regression
- Support vector machine(SVM)
- Multilayer perceptron(MLP)
- Random Forest
- Boosting
using 5 fold crossvalidation
### Random Forest was best among all but latency was high.
